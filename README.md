# Vegan products database.
The concept behind the project is to easily look up vegan products in polish stores. Let's say you're about to go to Lidl and you want to know if they have any vegan dinner options available. By clicking three times (I assume you are on the project's homepage :)) you are getting everything you wanted. By signing up you will be able to add your own products and if needed, edit them later on. Vegan community is strong, so they will add products by their own and happily inform each other that something new arrived.
